# HedgeFunds
A study of performance data from Eurekahedge.

The principal files in this project are the components of the Shiny app in the sub-directory HedgeFunds.  
The app is designed for somebody (such as a board member of a pension fund) who wants to learn more about
Hedge Funds and in particular, whether they continue to represent good investment options.  The app shows
performance over the past 20 years of various collections of funds, broken down by style and size.

The data required by the app is contained in the two .csv files, and was generated using the .py files.

The app is hosted <a href='https://simondyates.shinyapps.io/hedgefundreturns/'>here</a>.
